btrbu
=====

btrbu is another btrfs snapshot and backup script.  I wrote it because my needs were modest and it seemed like a nice project to sink my teeth into.  It will bootstrap itself if no backups exist and uses a keep policy similar to that of borg (ie- specifying a number of keeps at different time intervals).  It's written in lua, because lua lends itself to sensible looking config files in it's native syntax and lua is a pretty easy language to use.

The information btrbu needs is minimal- a snapshot directory, an archive name and a subvolume that corresponds to that name.  If a backup is desired, then a backup path must also be specified.  For now, it is assumed that the destination is a btrfs file system since the script takes advantage of btrfs send/receive commands.

Usage
-----

For simple snapshot and backup needs, a command can be as simple as:

    btrbu --snapshot-dir=/pool/snapshots --backup-dir=/backup archive1=/path/to/subvolume

Assuming a start from nothing, this will take a snapshot of `/path/to/subvolume` and place it in `/poolsnapshots` with a timestamp suffix.  So the snapshot name will be of the form `archive.YYYYMMddhhmm`.  This snapshot will then be used to send a full backup to `/backup`. 

Subsequent use of this same command will result in incremental backups which will just advance the timestamp associated with the archive.  The default keep policy is 1 day, so only 1 snapshot and backup are kept.

More than 1 archive can be specified on the command line:

    btrbu --snapshot-dir=/pool/snapshots --backup-dir=/backup archive1=/path/to/subvolume archive2=/path/to/subvolume2

These archives will share the same snapshot and backup destination, but obviously have different names qualified with a timestamp.

Configuration Files
-------------------

At some point, if backing up several differnt subvolumes for instanct, a configuration file might become desirable to make the command line more manageable.  btrbu will look for a configufation file in `~/.config/btrbu-conf` if no file is specified on the command line.  Alternatively:

    btrbu --config=/path/to/myconfig

Configuration files take advantage of lua's table syntax.  Don't worry, it's extremely easy to use.  A configuration file looks simply like so:

```
    return { 
        subvolumes =  {
            archive1="/path/to/subvolume1",
            archive2="/path/to/subvolume2",
            archive3="/path/to/subvolume3",
        },
        -- the leading double-dash means a comment to lua, so that can be taken
        -- advantage of as well
        snapshot_dir = "/pool/snapshots",
        backup_dir = "/backup",
    }
```

If an option can be specified on the command line, it can also be specified in the configuration file.  Be sure to susbstitute a `'_'` for any `'-'` characters in the command line option.  So the `--snapshot-dir` option would be specified as `snapshot_dir` in a configuration file.

Configuration files and command line options can be mixed and matched as well.  The rule is that the command line overrides any configuration file settings.  For archive name/ subvolume pairs, anything specified on the command line overrides ALL of the subvolumes in the configuration file.  So if there are 5 subvolumes specified in the configuration file, but a single achive/subvolume is specified on the command line, only the command line archive/subvolume is dealt with.  Basically, btrbu assumes the user knows what they are doing and tries not to get in the way.

Keep Policy
-----------

btrbu uses a keep policy for snapshots similar to [borgbackup][].  It uses daily, weekly and monthly timeframes to determine what to keep.  The timeframes are applied in ascending order and there is no overlap, meaning a snapshot/backup kept because of a daily keep doesn't count towards a weekly or monthly keep.  The keep is ALWAYS the most recent available for a given timeframe.

When first starting up, weekly and monthly keeps will not apply until those timeframes become relevant.  Weekly timeframes are referenced from Saturday, meaning that weekly keeps won't be applied until a Saturday backup becomes available.  Similarly, monthly keeps will not apply until snapshots and backups are made in a new month, since daily and weekly keeps will initially satisfy a monthly requirement.
