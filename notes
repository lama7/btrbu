dev branch-
    - Want to add "hooks" for snapshots and backups so a user can specify another command to be run
      after the snapshots/backups are done
 
prune branch-
    - change the prune option to specify a particular timestamp, or a list of timestamps to prune
    - this should also provide for some kind of ability to control WHAT is removed based on the timestamp
    - for instance, remove only snapshots with these timestamps, or only backups... or only snapshots 
      with a certain name
